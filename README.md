# Portfolio site created with React

## User story
This is portfolio site created to showcase my latest projects. Any visitors to this site will be able to visit my GitHub and LinkedIn pages via links on the Contact page - they'll also be able to contact me via the Contact form, where I'll receive their message in my email inbox. 

## Libraries 
I've used the MUI library for the navigation and drawer components. The rest of the components have been been with basic html and css. 

I have also used React Router to set up pages for the site. 

## Features 

### Landing page
This sites a landing page with my 'mission statement' i.e. letting the user know that this site is a portfolio for my front end projects. 

### Projects
There is separate page for my latest projects, with links to the GitHub repo and deployed link. 

### Contact page and contact form
On the contact page the user can see contact info, such as LinkedIn profile and email. There is also a fully functioning contact form that the user can fill out if they have a query or message, which was set up using Web3forms. These messages go to my email inbox.  

### Responsive pages
Where necessary certain components have React media queries to make the pages responsive.
